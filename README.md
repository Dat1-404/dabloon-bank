# dabloon-bank
A bank to store TikTok's fictional currency, dabloons!

What is it?
Dabloons are a fictional currency made on TikTok.
Currently, there are a bunch of thieves that steal people's dabloons!
So, I, TikTok user @dat1___, made the first ever interactive bank for them.
Just note that it isn't actual money.
